How I edit the code
There are a few different ways I work with this project:
Using my IDE locally
I cloned the repository and set it up with Node.js & npm (I recommend installing with nvm).
Steps I follow:
# Step 1: Clone the repository
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Step 2: Go into the project directory
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# Step 3: Install dependencies
npm i

# Step 4: Start the development server
npm run dev
Editing directly in GitHub
Sometimes, I make quick changes directly in GitHub by:
Navigating to the file
Clicking the edit (pencil) icon
Committing the changes
Using GitHub Codespaces
I also use Codespaces for quick cloud development:
Open the repo → Code → Codespaces → New Codespace
Edit files directly there
Commit & push changes
Deployment
I can deploy this project easily to platforms like Vercel, Netlify, or even GitHub Pages.
Custom Domain
Yes – I can connect a custom domain through the hosting provider’s settings (e.g., in Vercel or Netlify).
